## Pig Dice
A game for week 4 at Epicodus, June 15, 2016

By Julia Dickey and Brett New

### Description

This game allows 2 users to play the game. Each user can roll a dice, adding to their total score until they choose to hold and retain the points earned on their turn, or until they roll a one. If the user rolls a 1, they lose all points earned on that turn, and the other player gets to roll. The winner is the user whose total score reaches 100 first.  

### Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the github repository. The site can be found here on GitHub, or click here to view it on the web.
* Open index.html in the browser of your choice.
* Player one clicks on the "roll" button to begin the game.
* Continue play until one of the players reaches 100 points.


### Specifications

When a user hits the "roll" button, a random number will be generated from 1-6, and displayed on the page.

If the rolled number is >1, the number will be added to their score, and they can hit the roll button again.

If the rolled number is 1, the player is alerted that their turn is over, and they get no additional points for that turn.

For each roll, the new value is added to the player's total score.

The player's rolls for their current turns will be displayed at the bottom of the page.

When a player's total score equals 100, the game is over, and that player wins.
